# HastyScribe

_HastyScribe_ is a simple command-line program able to convert [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) files into HTML files.

## Usage

**hastyscribe** _filename-or-glob-expression_ **[** _\<options\>_ **]**

Where:

- _filename-or-glob-expression_ is a valid file or [glob](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)>) expression that will be compiled into HTML.
- The following options are supported:
  - **\-\-field/&lt;field&gt;=&lt;value&gt;** causes HastyScribe to set a custom field to a specific value.
  - **\-\-notoc** causes HastyScribe to output HTML documents _without_ automatically generating a Table of Contents at the start.
  - **\-\-user-css=&lt;file&gt;** causes HastyScribe to insert the contents of the specified local file as a CSS stylesheet.
  - **\-\-user-js=&lt;file&gt;** causes HastyScribe to insert the contents of the specified local file as a Javascript script.
  - **\-\-output-file=&lt;file&gt;** causes HastyScribe to write output to a local file (Use [\-\-output-file=-](class:opt) to output to standard output).
  - **\-\-watermark=&lt;file&gt;** causes HastyScribe to embed and display an image as a watermark throughout the document.
  - **\-\-fragment** causes HastyScribe to output just an HTML fragment instead of a full document, without embedding any image, font or stylesheet.
  - **\-\-dump=all|styles|fonts** causes HastyScribe to dump all resources/stylesheets/fonts to the current directory.
  - **\-\-help** causes HastyScribe to display the usage information and quit.

## FAQs

### Why is _HastyScribe_ different from other markdown converters?

Because:

- It is a cross-platform, self-contained executable file.
- It can generate standalone HTML files.
- It comes with its own stylesheet, which is automatically embedded into every HTML document, along with all the needed web fonts.
- It is built on top of [Discount][discount], which means that besides standard markdown you also get:
  - strikethrough
  - automatic Table of Contents generation
  - [SmartyPants](http://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/) substitutions
  - paragraph centering
  - image sizes
  - definition lists
  - alphabetic lists
  - pseudo-protocols to generate `span` tags with arbitrary CSS classes, `abbr` tags, and anchors
  - class blocks
  - tables
  - fenced code blocks
  - [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/)-style document headers
- It automatically embeds any referenced image as data URI.
- It has supports for text snippets, custom fields, and substitution macros.

### What can I use it for?

_HastyScribe_ is best suited to produce self-contained documents such as essays, meeting notes, project status documents, and articles.

### What language is _HastyScribe_ implemented in?

HastyScribe is implemented in [Nim][nim], a very expressive language that compiles to C and is able to generate small, standalone and self-contained executable files.
